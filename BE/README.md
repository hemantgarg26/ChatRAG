# VideoProcessing

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Installation and Application Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash git clone <repository-url>```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
```bash python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate```

3. Install dependencies
```bash pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Configure your environment variables
   Copy the example environment file and update it with the requirement values:
   ```bash cp .env.example .env```

## Running the application
```bash uvicorn main:app --reload```

## For Local Testing
1. Start Redis Container in a different terminal ```docker run -p 6379:6379 redis```
2. Start Celery task Queue in a different terminal ```celery -A app.core.worker.celery worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=1```


The application will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/api/health/check`
- Check Application is running or not: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Docs: ```http://localhost:8000/docs```


Key Notes
1. DTOs: Centralized under dtos/ to ensure consistency of request/response schema and avoid duplicating validation logic.
2. Environment Separation: config.py under core/ loads and manages all environment-specific variables on application start. (Preventing fetch repeatedly from env file (Operational Overhead prevention))
3. DB Access: Utilities for database interaction are split into:
  db_connect.py (used in main app – synchronous)
  db_connect via Celery tasks (handled differently due to async-sync incompatibilities)
4. Celery Tasks: worker.py sets up the Celery worker and broker configuration, while celery_core.py runs background processing tasks. (Async Context maintained vai asyncio)


## Architecture

## Architecture Components
1. ```FastAPI```
    Purpose: Python web framework used for building APIs.
    Why FastAPI:
      Natively supports asynchronous programming (async / await)
      High performance (based on Starlette and Pydantic)
      Automatically generates interactive API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI)
    Note: Runs in a single-threaded event loop — async operations must be used for I/O-bound tasks to maximize throughput.
2.  ```Uvicorn```
    Purpose: ASGI server used to serve the FastAPI app.
    Why Uvicorn:
      Ideal for asynchronous web frameworks.
      Fast, lightweight, and production-ready.
      Alternatives:
        Gunicorn (WSGI): For sync frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django).
        Uvicorn + Gunicorn: Common combo for production — Gunicorn manages multiple Uvicorn worker processes for scalability.
3. ```MongoDB```
    Purpose: Primary database for application data.
    Why MongoDB:
      Document-oriented — ideal for flexible data like video metadata, S3 URLs, processing states.
      Schema-less structure aligns with dynamic and evolving data formats.
    Note: User data (credentials, billing, etc.) could be stored in an RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    If both are needed, options include:
      One service handling both MongoDB + SQL (increased complexity)
      Microservices architecture to isolate concerns and data layers.
4. ```Redis (as Message Broker)```
    Purpose: Broker between FastAPI and Celery for task distribution.
    Why Redis:
      In-memory store → very low latency.
      Lightweight and easy to deploy.
    Alternatives:
      RabbitMQ: Durable messaging with delivery guarantees; higher setup complexity.
      Kafka: Ideal for large-scale, distributed event streaming systems; higher throughput and durability.
      Decision Basis: Redis chosen for speed and simplicity in async task queuing.
5. ```Celery```
    Purpose: Asynchronous task queue for handling background jobs.
    Use Cases:
      Video processing
      Metadata generation
      Thumbnail creation
    Integration:
      Works with Redis (or RabbitMQ) as the broker
      Worker tasks are defined and run via worker.py
6. ```Amazon S3 (Object Storage)```
    Purpose: Store all large unstructured data such as:
    Uploaded video files
    Generated thumbnails
    Processed video outputs
    Why S3:
      Scalable, durable (99.999999999%), and cost-effective
      Supports direct upload/download and pre-signed URLs for secure access

# Implementation Decisions
1. Created an Application Level Middleware for centralized authentication and authorization
2. Created a global MongoConnection on application start (One Connection per application - Prevent connection exhaustion for DB)
3. Loading .env once on application start
4. Validation with video file in memory on video uploads - Prevents unnecessary video uploads in S3, Prevents thundering herd per user
5. Using asyncio in celery worker - Celery is Synchronous by nature and does not support FastAPIs async-await. Using asyncio.get_event_loop() and asyncio.new_event_loop(), preventing asyncio to close event loops on a single operation. (Without this, only one request will be processed, the next request will get an error - ```Event Loop Closed```)
6. Custom Success and Error codes at the application level for proper error messaging to user.
7. Saving status (Saved, Processing, Processed, Failed), for each task in mongoDb.
8. Created an API for fetching task status, Can be extended to use sockets.
